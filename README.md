# Systemic-Risk
Analysis of Different Measures  of Systemic Risk

**Dataset: Not Added


The concept of Value at Risk (VaR) has become the standard measure that financial
analysts use to quantify the market risk. VaR is commonly defined as the maximum
potential fall in the value of a portfolio (i.e., loss in portfolio) of financial instruments with
a given probability over a certain horizon. It has now become an essential tool for
monitoring risk, and in particular, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(1996) imposes requirements on banks to meet capital requirements based on the VaR
estimated through internal model approach.

There are several measures of systemic risk suggested by different author. The list
includes Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR), Delta CovaR
(ΔCCoVaR), SRISK and rSYR. These measures have been well accepted in the literature as
many studies have analysed the systemic risk of global banks.

This is an exploratory study which aims at estimating VaR, CoVaR and Delta CoVaR for a
total of 31 Indian banks and 20 non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) over a period of
10 years from March 2007 to March 2017 using rolling-window approach.

We consider the Indian banking set-up because of unprecedented risk and uncertainty
over various dimensions of its working recently, with some major cases of default and,
record losses reported since FY1999. The State Bank of India reported a major decline
in profits in 2016 and the figures seem to have deteriorated since then, reaching
mammoth 6547.45Cr for FY2017-18. The default on repayments by Infrastructure
Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), PNB-Nirav Modi case and selling of
commercial papers of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) on
discount have added to this distress.


The results of estimated VaR, CoVaR and ΔCCoVaR along with the log returns of
three systemically important banks from 2007 to 2017 are represented in the
three panels below.
